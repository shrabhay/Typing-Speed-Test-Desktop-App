        "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. Everything was in confusion in "
        "the Oblonskys' house. The wife had discovered that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with a French girl,"
        " who had been a governess in their family, and she had announced to her husband that she could not go on "
        "living in the same house with him. This position of affairs had now lasted three days, and not only the "
        "husband and wife themselves, but all the members of their family and household, were painfully conscious of "
        "it. Every person in the house felt that there was no sense in their living together, and that the stray people"
        " brought together by chance in any inn had more in common with one another than they, the members of the "
        "family and household of the Oblonskys. The wife did not leave her own room, the husband had not been at home "
        "for three days. The children ran wild all over the house; the English governess quarreled with the "
        "housekeeper, and wrote to a friend asking her to look out for a new situation for her; the man-cook had walked"
        " off the day before just at dinner time; the kitchen-maid, and the coachman had given warning. ('Anna "
        "Karenina' by Leo Tolstoy)",

        "There was no hope for him this time: it was the third stroke. Night after night I had passed the house (it was"
        " vacation time) and studied the lighted square of window: and night after night I had found it lighted in the "
        "same way, faintly and evenly. If he was dead, I thought, I would see the reflection of candles on the darkened"
        " blind for I knew that two candles must be set at the head of a corpse. He had often said to me: 'I am not "
        "long for this world,' and I had thought his words idle. Now I knew they were true. Every night as I gazed up "
        "at the window I said softly to myself the word paralysis. It had always sounded strangely in my ears, like the"
        " word gnomon in the Euclid and the word simony in the Catechism. But now it sounded to me like the name of "
        "some maleficent and sinful being. It filled me with fear, and yet I longed to be nearer to it and to look upon"
        " its deadly work. ('Dubliners' by James Joyce)",

        "Then rode Merlin unto Arthur and the two kings, and told them how he had sped; whereof they had great marvel, "
        "that man on earth might speed so soon, and go and come. So Merlin told them ten thousand were in the forest of"
        " Bedegraine, well armed at all points. Then was there no more to say, but to horseback went all the host as "
        "Arthur had afore purveyed. So with twenty thousand he passed by night and day, but there was made such an "
        "ordinance afore by Merlin, that there should no man of war ride nor go in no country on this side Trent water,"
        " but if he had a token from King Arthur, where through the king's enemies durst not ride as they did to-fore "
        "to espy. ('Le Morte D'Arthur' by Thomas Malory)"

        "In several countries history textbooks are tools to foster nationalism and patriotism, and give students the "
        "official line about national enemies. In many countries, history textbooks are sponsored by the national "
        "government and are written to put the national heritage in the most favourable light. For example, in Japan, "
        "mention of the Nanking Massacre has been removed from textbooks and the entire Second World War is given "
        "cursory treatment. Other countries have complained. It was standard policy in communist countries to present "
        "only a rigid Marxist historiography. In the United States, especially the southern part history about slavery "
        "and the American Civil War are controversial topics. McGraw-Hill Education for example, was criticised for "
        "describing Africans brought to American plantations as 'workers' instead of slaves in a textbook. Academic "
        "historians have often fought against the politicization of the textbooks, sometimes with success. In 21st-"
        "century Germany, the history curriculum is controlled by the 16 states, and is characterized not by "
        "superpatriotism but rather by an 'almost pacifistic and deliberately unpatriotic undertone' and reflects "
        "'principles formulated by international organizations such as UNESCO or the Council of Europe, thus oriented "
        "towards human rights, democracy and peace.' The result is that 'German textbooks usually downplay national "
        "pride and ambitions and aim to develop an understanding of citizenship centered on democracy, progress, human "
        "rights, peace, tolerance and Europeanness.'",
